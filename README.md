# Celery Flower monitoring for Heroku

[Flower](https://github.com/mher/flower/) is a handy tool for monitoring [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) processes. As it's build on top of Tornado web server it needs it's own outside facing port and can't be run as part of your regular Heroku app which only provides one ```web``` process type. Luckily Flower is really easy to install as another app and can be run free of charge on Heroku.

This project template/guide helps you to bootstrap the process and creates a simple app for running Flower.

Clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/orneryhippo/celery-flower-heroku.git

Create an Heroku app, either autogenerated or specified by you (must be unique):

    heroku create 
or 
    heroku create YOUR_UNIQUE_APP_NAME
    


Configure the app by providing a password for logging into Flower:
    
    heroku config:set FLOWER_BASIC_AUTH="username:password"

your broker url (RabbitMQ, Redis, what have you)
    
    [Adding an Addon Element to your Heroku app will create a BROKER_URL=redis://... entry in settings]
    for advanced Heroku users, you can use the Heroku CLI commands
    
Don't do this unless you want to break things:
    heroku config:set BROKER_URL=redis://...
    
    

    
Push to heroku:

    git push heroku master

Now visit the app at YOUR_UNIQUE_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com (with the YOUR_UNIQUE_APP_NAME heroku created above). It will ask for a username and a password which you defined with the FLOWER_BASIC_AUTH environment variable above.
